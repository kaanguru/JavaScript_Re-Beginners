To see errors and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, “developer tools” have been embedded in browsers.

Developer tools allow us to see errors, run commands, examine variables.

Press F12 The developer tools will open on the Console tab by default.

## CodePen and JsFiddle

CodePen and JsFiddle are web based development environments.

They allow us to write code in the browser, and see the results of it as you build.
They are online code editors for front-end developers learning to code.

::: tip
We will use pure JavaScript which is sometimes called Vanilla JavaScript.
We will learn all JavaScript Fundamentals using Visual Studio Code but I will share example codes using editable public CodePen Pens.
