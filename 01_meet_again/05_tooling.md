## Developer Console

In the browser, users don’t see errors by default. So, if something goes wrong in the script, we won’t see what’s broken and can’t fix it.

::: tip
**Errors are our friends**

Developers should read all error messages and learn from them.
:::

To see errors and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, “developer tools” have been embedded in browsers.

Developer tools allow us to see errors, run commands, examine variables.

Press F12 The developer tools will open on the Console tab by default.

## CodePen and JsFiddle

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/features/) and [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) are web based development environments.

They allow us to write code in the browser, and see the results of it as you build.
They are online code editors for front-end developers learning to code.

::: tip
We will use pure JavaScript which is sometimes called Vanilla JavaScript.
We will learn all JavaScript Fundamentals using Visual Studio Code but I will share example codes using editable public CodePen Pens.

## Node.js

Node.js is the cross-platform environment that lets developers write command line tools and server-side scripts outside of a browser.

## Visual Studio Code

As a professional developer, you will use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and most certainly Visual Studio Code

* Syntax Coloring
* Error and Warning Marks
* Format Document

**Git Support:** Resources can be pulled from Git Hub Repo online and vice-versa; saving can be done too. Resource pulling also means cloning the code which is made available on the internet. This code can later be changed and saved.

**Terminal Support:** Many of the times, the user needs to start from the root of the directory to start with a particular action, in-built terminal or console provides user support to not to switch in-between two screens for the same.

**Intelli-Sense:** It can detect if any snippet of code is left incomplete. Also, common variable syntaxes and variable declarations are made automatically. Ex: If a certain variable is being used in the program and the user has forgotten to declare, intelli-sense will declare it for the user.

## ESLint

We will find and fix problems in your JavaScript code using ESLint
