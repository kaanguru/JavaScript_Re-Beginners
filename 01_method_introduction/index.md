## 20 Years of Coding Professionally

I am 47 years old software developer from Turkiye. I build web applications for 20 years.
But last 5 years, I have noticed there were strange technological developments in javascript. I started to see some codes around which did not make any sense to me. It was clear I was missing some details.

So I decided to start over from beginning.  I've **re-learned** everything about javascript. I prepared this course to share my experience in this re-learning process. <FontIcon icon="route" size="23" color="Crimson"/>
