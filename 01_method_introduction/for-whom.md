JavaScript for re-beginners is for young software students,who wants to have a strong background and interested in a complete javascript guide.

I want to share my 20 years of expertise to build a strong fundamental background your your software development career.  

I believe understanding how languages works is important. That's why I spend so much time on organizing this course.
It's intended for programmers who have been working with JavaScript at a beginner level and are now ready for a more sophisticated relationship with the language. JavaScript is a surprisingly powerful but most misunderstood language.
May be you had some coding lessons previously but feeling like youâ€™ve missed some basics.
This step-by-step approuch is probably for you.
I will explain low-level fundamentals first, and then build on those to more
advanced and higher-level concepts

Once you learn syntax of JavaScript which is similar to Java language, you will be able to learn  Typescript which is a strict data typing extension of javascript.
Next you can even learn some modern languages like Dart and Kotlin which has similar syntax too.

It may take time to get used to my accent but you will learn to code for real
